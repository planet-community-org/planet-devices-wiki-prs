Cosmo Communicator has 2 processors, one running Android and the other
supporting the cover display. There are 2 firmware upgrade processes
required to update your Cosmo.

##### Upgrading Android firmware

The latest Android firmware should be detected automatically by your
Cosmo if connected to a network. To proceed with the installation, run
the Settings application and select System.

#####  Updating the Cover Display firmware

Once the Android firmware is updated, it is recommended to update the
companion Cover Display firmware. To do this, navigate and run the Cover
Display Assistant app.
