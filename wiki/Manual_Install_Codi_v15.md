Starting with Android firmware version v25, Codi v15 can be installed
automatically using the Cover Display application.

This section is now outdated - it explains how to manually install Codi
v15 using Android firmware v23.

To take full advantage of the latest features (such as CoDi trackpad
control) you will need to manually install CoDi v15. Flashing this
firmware is a relatively quick process, because it does not contain the
(big) resource file. However, you should make sure you have the latest
v14 CoDi firmware and resources before starting this update.

Once your CoDi is running v14, you can proceed to manually flash version
v15. You will need to download the firmware from this
location:Â [<http://support.planetcom.co.uk/download/Cosmo_firmware-stem_ospi2_mouse15.bin>](http://support.planetcom.co.uk/download/Cosmo_firmware-stem_ospi2_mouse15.bin)
(save it to the internal memory into the root directory) and install it
manually using the Cover Display Assistant app on Android.

The flashing process does not need the second resource file but it
assumes that the v14 firmware is installed.

To update the CoDi firmware click on the "FLASH NOW" button. **After
flashing, please ignore any over-the-air Cover Display assistant
notifications to update firmware as this is a custom build.**</span>
