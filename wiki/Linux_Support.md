## Linux Installation Notes.

**NOTE: This page is now obsolete. Please refer to the updated [Linux
Flashing Guide](Linux_Flashing_Guide "wikilink").**

The following steps will allow you to flash an original Android firmware
or a Linux dual boot firmware. At the moment the flash tool only
supports Windows.

**Please note: <span style="color: #ff0000;">Flashing Android or Linux
will delete any user data on the device. Please make sure you have a
backup of any important data before starting!</span>**

1.  Install Windows FlashTool
    [drivers](http://support.planetcom.co.uk/download/FlashToolDrivers.zip).
    **Note: The drivers have been updated to improve compatibility with
    Windows 10.**
2.  Download the [Flashing
    tool](http://support.planetcom.co.uk/download/FlashTool.zip)
3.  Use it with one of the following firmware:
    -   [Android firmware
        v1.0](http://support.planetcom.co.uk/download/Gemini_Android_1_1_0.zip)
    -   [Dual boot Android - Debian linux - Technology
        preview](http://support.planetcom.co.uk/download/Gemini_Debian_TP.zip)

[Here you can find information about the flashing

Please note that Linux support is still under development at the moment,
and the Debian technology preview is mainly for people who wants to
experiment with it. We will provide updated firmwares in the next few
weeks, please stay tuned!
