##  Saving logs

After the last action, logs are now being saved on the device. It's a
good idea to restart the unit at this point, so that any log related to
device initialisation is also recorded. After reboot, please repeat the
action that causes the trouble. When the issue has been reproduced,
simply scoll down form the top to reveal the MTKLogger menu and stop the
logger.

## Sending the logs to Planet Computers

The logs created by MTKLogger are in the /mtklog folder in the Internal
Storage. One way to send the logs back to Planet Computers is to connect
your Gemini to a computer, copy the mtkfolder to the computer, compress
it and then sendÂ  the archive using a cloud service, such as
