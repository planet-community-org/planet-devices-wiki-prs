##  USB-related issues

-   Gemini supports a Mediatek fast-charge technology called Pump
    Express. The original Gemini box contains a specialÂ  mains charger
    that allows recharging your Gemini in a very short time. You might
    be able to charge your Gemini using other chargers, but please bear
    in mind that only a Pump Express compatible charger will allow fast
    charghing a Gemini.
-   About USB interfaces:
    -   The left hand side USB supports Gemini USB-C hub, power, PC
        connectivity and OTG connectivity.
    -   The right hand side USB supports 1 slave (OTG) device (for
        example 1 memory card or 1 mouse) or the Gemini HDMI cable
        adapter.


## Compass functionality

Despite the compass sensor being present on the unit, the compass
functionality has been removed from the firmware because of interference
with the magnets used to keep the unit closed and make the device
altogether thinner by pressing the keys down.

## Gemini Voice Assistant

Due to Google updating their voice assistant and Google search, the
voice assistant (right-end side) button now only works if there is no
screen saver or screen lock option set on your Gemini. Also, please make
sure that your Gemini Voice Assistant app and your Google search and
voice assistant app are up-to-date from the Android Play store.
