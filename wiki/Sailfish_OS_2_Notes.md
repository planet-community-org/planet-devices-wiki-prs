In case your system start directly with the PIN screen as in the picture
above, please restart your machine as otherwise the setup configuration
is known to not complete properly. If the problem persists, try
re-flashing the linux and the sailfish_boot partition (either boot2 or
boot3) only. It has been reported that reflashing the linux and
sailfish_boot partition fixes the issue,
we</span><span class="mw-headline"> are investigating this. Also you can

## <span class="mw-headline">Power key and Esc (On) key</span>

On Sailfish, the Esc (On) key sends the an escape character. To send a
power event, use the key combination: Fn + Esc (On).

When you boot Sailfish OS for the first time, a few things are
initialised and the screen might turn black because of the screen
timeout. If that happens, just press Fn + Esc (On) to send a power event
and wake up the screen, or simply close your Gemini and open it again.

To power off the unit, press and hold Fn + Esc (On) for a few seconds
until the poweroff menu appear on screen.

## <span id="Linux_boot_notes" class="mw-headline">Linux boot notes</span>

The multi-boot mechanism works as follows.

Starting from a switched OFF Gemini, press the Esc (On) key to start the
unit until the Gemini vibrates. Once you feel the vibration you can
choose the boot mode by pressing the following key combination:

-   Boot 1: This is the default booting option when no keys or buttons
    are pressed.
-   Recovery Mode: Esc (On) is pressed. This will always boot into
    recovery mode.
-   Boot 2: silver right-end side button is pressed.
-   Boot 3: Both Esc(On) key and silver right-end side button are
    pressed at the same time

Keep the keys/buttons pressed until the screen turns ON.
