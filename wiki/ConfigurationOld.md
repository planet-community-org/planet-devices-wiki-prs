Selecting the right keyboard layout is sometimes complicated as you can
have a number of active keyboard methods at the same time, and each
keyboard method can be configured with a different layout.

To simplify this we updated our keyboard application adding a
configuration process.

You should have automatically received an over the air update containing
the latest keyboard version. If you are unsure, you can always check if
an update is available:

-   Press Fn + Del to go to Settings

-   scroll down and tap on About Phone


![](GemKB-Method1-3-C.png "GemKB-Method1-3-C.png")

-   tap on "WirelessUpdate"


![](GemKB-Method1-4-C.png "GemKB-Method1-4-C.png")

-   tap on "Detection of update" (english translation will be improved
    in the next release). Follow the process to complete the firmware
    update.

Alternative you can also update the application manually:

1.  press the planet key to popup the application bar

    the **Configure** option and simply follow the on screen
    instructions.


## Configuring US Language/Keyboard layout

In this section we will see how to configure Gemini for a specific
language and keyboard layout, in this case English US. Please see the
previous section to update the keyboard application before start.

1.  Run the Gemini keyboard application and select the "Configure"
    option.

    ![](Config-US-S1-1-C.png "Config-US-S1-1-C.png")
2.  Tap on "Select your preferred language" and select your language.
    Optionally, you can remove any other language. Your screen should
    look like the following

    ![](Config-US-S1-8-C.png "Config-US-S1-8-C.png")
3.  Tap the back button to go back to the configurator

    ![](Screenshot_20180504-153431.png "Screenshot_20180504-153431.png")
4.  Now tap on "Enable Gemini Keyboard". From the list that will popup
    you should choose the Gemini keyboard option. We strongly recommend
    to deselect all the other methods, as having multiple method enabled
    can easily confuse users. Your screen should look like the
    following
    ![](Screenshot_20180504-153440.png "Screenshot_20180504-153440.png")
5.  Tap the back button to go back to the configurator

    ![](Config-US-S3-1-C.png "Config-US-S3-1-C.png")
6.  Tap on "Switch input method" and select the Gemini Keybord input
    method. You should see only one method here. If you see multiple
    methods, start this process again and make sure you remove the other
    methods as explained in point 4.

    ![](Config-US-S4-1-C.png "Config-US-S4-1-C.png")
8.  Finally tap on Configure your keyboard layout to select the
    appropriate layout. Please make sureÂ  that you select a "Gemini
    Keyboard" and not an "Android Keyboard", otherwise some keys will
    not work as expected. See the first option in the following
    screenshot

    ![](Screenshot_20180504-1535182.png "Screenshot_20180504-1535182.png")
9.  Congratulations, your language and keyboard layout has been
    successfully configured!

## <span id="Boot_mode_options" class="mw-headline">Boot mode options</span>

Gemini supports a few boot mode options, based on the firmware you are
using.

-   **Android-only firmware**
    -   Press Esc (On) for around one second to turn ON the unit and
        boot into Android.
    -   Press Esc (On) for around one second to turn ON the unit and at
        the same time press and hold the side button until the screen
        turns ON to boot in recovery mode. At this stage the recovery
        mode is disabled and you will see a droid image with a red
        triangle and a "No command" text.

<!-- -->

-   **Dual boot Android-Linux firmware**
    -   Press Esc (On) for around one second to turn ON the unit and
        boot into Android. You should release the Esc (On) button before
        the screen turns ON, otherwise the unit will boot into recovery
        mode (see below).
    -   Press Esc (On) for around one second to turn ON the unit and at
        the same time press and hold the side button until the screen
        turns ON to boot into Linux. You should release the Esc (On)
        button before the screen turns ON, but you must keep the side
        button pressed until you see the turning ON. When the screen
        turns ON you can release the side button, and the unit will boot
        into Linux.
    -   Press Esc (On) and keep pressing the button until the screen
        turns ON to boot in recovery mode. At this stage the recovery
        mode is disabled and you will see a droid image with a red
        triangle and a "No command" text.


To force a restart if the unit is stuck in recovery mode or in fastboot
mode keep pressed the Esc (On) key button for about 20 seconds until you
feel the gemini vibrate and booting.
