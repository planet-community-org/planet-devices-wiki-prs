The following guide explains how to manually update the Cosmo
Communicator firmware from version 20 to version 21.

To manually update to the v21 firmware proceed as follows:

1.  From your Cosmo, download the [v21
    firmware](https://support.planetcom.co.uk/download/CosmoFirmware/fota_v20_v21_update/Updatepackage.zip)
    and save it in the default Downloads folder. The downloaded file is
    named Updatepackage.zip
2.  The next step will move the Updatepackage.zip file from the
    Downloads folder to the root of the internal storage:
    -   Run the **Files**application
    -   From the Downloads folder, long-tap on the Updatepackage.zip
        file, then tap on the three-dots icon on the top left of the
        screen and select 'Move to...'

After the installation ends, your device will reboot and it will prompt
for the current password. The device might complain about the password
being wrong, and eventually will present a screen showing 'Decryption
Unsuccessful", as in the screenshot below.
