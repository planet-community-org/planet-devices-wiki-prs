The Kali Linux community released a version of Kali Linux for Gemini PDA
(see
[<https://www.kali.org/news/kali-linux-for-the-gemini-pda/>](https://www.kali.org/news/kali-linux-for-the-gemini-pda/)).

We integrated this image in our Flash Partition tool to simplify the
installation for some users. For installation instruction, see [Linux
Flashing Guide](Linux_Flashing_Guide "wikilink").

This page provides information about running Kali Linux on your Gemini.

## Default user/password

The default user name is 'root' and the password is 'toor'.

## Configuring WIFI and Blutooth

You can configure your WIFI and Bluetooth settings using the 'Connman UI
Setup' application, which you can find under the Internet settings, as

The multi-boot mechanism works as follows.

Starting from a switched OFF Gemini, press the Esc (On) key to start the
unit until the Gemini vibrates. Once you feel the vibration you can
choose the boot mode by pressing the following key combination:

-   Boot 1: This is the default booting option when no keys or buttons
    are pressed.
-   Recovery Mode: Esc (On) is pressed. This will always boot into
    recovery mode.
-   Boot 2: silver right-end side button is pressed.
-   Boot 3: Both Esc(On) key and silver right-end side button are
    pressed at the same time

Keep the keys/buttons pressed until the screen turns ON.
