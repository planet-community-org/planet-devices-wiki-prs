# Astro: boot modes

The button combinations to access the various boot modes of the Astro Slide are listed here.

For Gemini/Cosmo boot mode button combinations, see the [Bootloader page on the Gemian wiki](https://github.com/gemian/gemian/wiki/Bootloader).

## Normal boot

Hold Power/Esc. When the device vibrates, release Power/Esc.

Note that if you've unlocked the bootloader, you'll need to press again to continue when prompted.

## Force a reboot

Hold Power/Esc. When the device vibrates, release Power/Esc.

## View charging state while powered down

While the device is powered down and charging, you can briefly show the screen displaying the graphical battery percentage by pressing the power button or Esc key.

## Recovery

Hold Power/Esc + Volume Up. When the device vibrates, release Power/Esc. When the screen turns on, release Volume Up.

After the bootloader screen, an Android graphic appears along with 'No command' in tiny writing.

Briefly press Power + Volume Up to display the menu.

## Fastboot

Hold Power/Esc + Volume Down. When the device vibrates, release Power/Esc. When the screen turns on, release Volume Down.

'Fastboot mode...' appears at the bottom of the (portrait) screen in tiny writing.

Note that fastboot can also be accessed from recovery, but looks different.

'Safe mode' is displayed at the bottom of the (portrait) lockscreen.
